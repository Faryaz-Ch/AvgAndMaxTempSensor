In this C# program, the user will simulate the sensors by entering the data. 
Program will 1st ask from the user for how many sensors are currently being deployed. The received 
number is then used (as array capacity) to create an array of temperatures (data type: double). The 
program then uses a loop to read the temperature values from the user and save in the array (Hint: youâ€™ll 
have to use the array length to control the iteration of the loop). 
Your program should calculate and display the following:
The average temperature.
The maximum temperature.
Number of temperatures between 10-20
